# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This repository contains code for segmenting customers based on their demographic and spending characteristics using K-Means clustering algorithm. The dataset used in this analysis is located in the data directory (data.csv).

# Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer

Gender: Gender of the customer

Age: Age of the customer

Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars

Spending Score (1-100): Spending score assigned to the customer based on their purchasing behavior

# problem Description
Customer Segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on shared characteristics such as demographics, behavior, or preferences. It is important in business analytics because it helps businesses understand their customers and tailor their marketing strategies to meet their specific needs. By segmenting customers, businesses can identify their most valuable customers, develop targeted marketing campaigns, and improve customer retention. With the help of customer segmentation, businesses can make data-driven decisions that ultimately lead to increased customer satisfaction and revenue.

# summary
A dataset of Customer data has been investigated for segmentationed based on the given features.

The dataset has been explored to identify any possible links between the features

The K-Means Clustering algorithm has been used to identify possible segmentations.

Clustering and its visualisations has been done for the three features: age, spending score, and annual income in pairs of two.

It can be seen that plotting a 3D-scatterplot with all three features yields the best visualisations of the segmented groups of Customers.
